		<p>I've got to say it's the Spanish language, and it says a lot about the integration and appreciation of our Mexican roots. Great to see that there is a growing recognition of the need to respect the language. Case in point, Menchaca Road, usually referred to as "Manshack." My husband's family members who have moved to Austin from El Paso have been flummoxed when they are told to take "Manshack" and they can't find it on the map. And when they learn later that it is actually "Manchaca," but should be "Menchaca," they're truly puzzled. Judge Bob Perkins (an honorary Mexican-American in my book) is leading the charge to change the name of the road and all the street signs to the correct spelling. According to the  Texas State Historical Association's Handbook of Texas, "José Antonio Menchaca of San Antonio served during the revolution under the command of Juan Seguín and fought in the Battle of San Jacinto." Point is that if we in Austin miss the point that Hispanics/Mexican-Americans have played key roles in our history, we fail to acknowledge the Spanish origin of "Menchaca" and "Guadalupe." </p>
		<p>We've made progress. Back when I was in college here in the mid-70s, one of my journalism classmates, Roy Ortega of El Paso, got fired from his radio reporting job because he refused to pronounce Guadalupe as "Guadaloop" – to mispronounce our heritage language, especially when we know better, is to celebrate ignorance. And we're in beautiful, smart, enlightened Austin, Texas: We're better than that!</p>

		<p>Our history and how and why it evolved that way. I've been working on an oral history of various aspects of the Latino experience in the U.S. Right now we're working on the Voting Rights Act (1975 renewal and expansion) and political empowerment of Latinos and have a growing understanding of why it took so long for Austin/Travis County to elect its first Mexican-American county commissioner,  Richard Moya in 1970; its first city councilman, John Trevino in 1975; its first state representative, Gonzalo Barrientos, also in 1975; first school board member, Gus Garcia, in 1972. Their relationship to language is interesting; all are fluent in both languages. But their parents were either monolingual Spanish or more comfortable in Spanish. And the generation of Mexican-Americans who followed them are more English-dominant. That has everything to do with how language has been treated. By the third generation of Mexican-Americans, the Spanish language is generally fairly weak. If the Spanish langauge were valued more broadly, younger people would be insisting on language maintenance and acquisition. </p>

		<p>It's all tied to demographics, and we all know where that is headed. We have to find resourceful ways to more firmly integrate Latinos into the fabric of our city, bringing with them the culture and enriching Austin. For instance, how can we expose our young children to all the wonderful possibilties available to them? How can we make sure that our young people will take advantage of every educational opportunity? I believe we're at a crossroads where we can look for the Class of 2026 at the Dell Medical School and see that they reflect the demographics of today's second-graders. That can be done if we have high expectations for them and if we celebrate all that they bring to the table – including the Spanish language.</p>
