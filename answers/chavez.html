		<p>I grew up in a mid-size house in the Allandale neighborhood that backs up to Shoal Creek. I remember my dad, a second-generation Mexican-American, showing me a copy of the deed to our house that clearly states that property in that area could not be sold to Mexicans or Blacks. WHAT?! The sentence is marked through but still legible, and I remember being appalled that such a statement, one made in ignorance and hate, would ever have been made, much less survive in writing to a time when my eyes could read it. I'd like to think we've come a long way since those times, but I'm not so sure we can pat ourselves on the back just yet. Regarding the culture of Austin, it's no secret that we are obsessed with tacos, hot sauce, queso and margaritas, which, though delicious, are at best a fusion loosely based on actual Mexican food. And there is definitely a hip factor to "being ethnic" or celebrating our "Latinness" on days like Dia De Los Muertos or Cinco de Mayo (the latter of which is not a celebrated in Mexico), but when those days are done, we put away the sombreros and soccer jerseys until the following year. </p>
		<p>Perhaps the biggest impact on the culture today is sheer numbers. I think most people are aware that Latinos will soon be the majority in Texas, and the purchasing and voting power that come with those numbers will shape our city more than anything else. Until then, I-35 still acts as a very real line that segregates our city and keeps us from truly interacting with the people whose food and culture we hail but whose language and way of life we do not truly understand. It also very much divides our schools, and as long as our schools are segregated along economic lines, we will never see true integration and sharing of cultures.</p>
		<p>Regarding music, I will say I'm constantly surprised by the positive responses I receive from music lovers of all ages and backgrounds. They seem to love the bilingual songs, and English speakers are often most drawn to the Spanish songs, wishing they, too, could understand all the lyrics. They truly seem to connect, not only to the infectious rhythms of our Latin-tinged music, but to the lyrics and emotion of the songs themselves, and I find that extremely refreshing. At the same time, the lack of variety of Latin music in Austin is frustrating. I am one of few in the category of Latin-folk/pop, and most people have no idea what to think when I tell them what style of music I play. Comparing myself to another artist they are familiar with inevitably leaves me with something like "Sarah Bareilles meets Selena," which is pretty far off base. </p>
		<p>There are people working to change the scene, though. The Pachanga Latin Festival brings in Latin artists from all over the world in a wide variety of styles and is honestly one of my absolute favorite festivals in the world, and it's right here! But to look at ACL and other major festivals and concerts here, you would think we were in Kansas for the lack of attention paid to Latin music. There just isn't a demand for it yet. And yet we're in Texas! Most native Spanish speakers here listen strictly to Tejano, banda and bachata, none of which you'll find in the mainstream in Austin. Aside from Pachanga, I have to travel to New York City, Washington, D.C, Los Angeles or Miami to sample the breadth of the Latin music scene. And in those cities I've found that Latin culture is everywhere! It's vibrant and inescapable. Here in Austin, it's a constant search. But there are a number of groups constantly working to bring our people and our culture to the forefront &mdash; Cine Las Americas, the Mexican American Cultural Center, Workers Defense Project, Pachanga Latino Music Festival, La Pena Art Gallery, Teatro Vivo, Casa Marianella, Aztlan Dance Company &mdash; and, as a proud Texan and a Latina who actively seeks a greater connection with her lost Latin roots, I'm grateful that they're here in Austin.</p>

		<p>Latinos have a very strong work ethic and are deeply committed to family. Any work is good work, and no work is too hard, whether busing our tables, digging ditches, caring for our elderly, cleaning our houses or constructing a new downtown high-rise. Latinos are literally shaping our city, building it brick by brick. But they're also being asked to pay the price, often with their health or even their lives. Everyone who works in our state, whether they have papers or not, has the right to receive fair pay for their work, but too many employers take advantage of Latinos who may not have proper documentation or don't speak English by refusing to pay them for their work, not giving them proper equipment on the job or denying them water or rest breaks, even in the summer. Every 2.5 days, a construction worker dies in Texas, making Texas the most deadly state in the nation for construction workers. Thanks to organizations like Workers Defense Project that fight for workers' rights, the word is starting to get out about these illegal practices, and slowly things are changing. WDP has been able to pass important ordinances at the city level and advocates for workers with companies like Apple who look to build in Austin. For most of us, the contributions of our Latino brothers and sisters and the sacrifices they make not only for their families, but also for our city, go completely unnoticed.</p>

		<p>Numbers and awareness. The more that I sing, the more I realize how many people there are like me: Latino by nature, gringo by nurture. I can sense a growing will to uncover our lost Latin roots, to celebrate the diversity of history and culture from all over Latin America, to learn the language of our ancestors. It doesn't hurt that you can actually get a better job or earn more money if you're bilingual nowadays. With topics like immigration and unaccompanied minors at the border at the forefront of our politics, the issues are definitely becoming more polarizing, but I hope it's also forcing people to think about who they are and where they've come from. But true cultural change will only come when Latinos can harness purchasing power and political power in order to demand better for our communities. I'm hoping that the new Austin City Council districts will give greater voice to Latinos (and other cultural communities) around Austin. I do think that the Latino community will only continue to gain importance in Austin and the nation as our numbers continue to rise. After all, 1 in every 11 children in the U.S. is born in Texas, which means nearly a tenth of the country's growth is happening here in Texas, a large portion of which is Latino. I'm not sure what the future holds, but I sure hope it means that Spanish can be heard in every Austin ZIP code, that people will know what a charango is when I tell them I play one, that more people will wear red, green and white on Dieciseis (Sept. 16), instead of May 5, and we'll truly celebrate our shared Latino culture by uplifting our Latino neighbors.</p>
