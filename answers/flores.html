		<p>The biggest impact Hispanic culture has had on Austin is multi-faceted: Food, music, dance, art, faith and family traditions have all played an important role in shaping the city of Austin. But I would start with food (and drink) &mdash; you cannot go a few blocks in any direction without encountering Mexican/Latino restaurants featuring Mexican/Latin American food and drinks.  And even non-Latino restaurants feature foods and drinks that are derived from the Latino tradition. I believe that food is the bridge that people most easily cross over in understanding different cultures. Even if you don't speak the language, you can experience a culture through its food and the customs and rituals that surround food.  Non-Hispanics begin to learn the language by learning the names of dishes and ingredients and are exposed to its art and music, which is often featured in restaurants. In addition, grocery stores in Austin have aisles dedicated to Mexican and Latin food &mdash; in fact, one grocery chain caters to the growing Hispanic community. </p>
		<p>Then there is the music: Johnny Degollado, Tish Hinojosa, Beto y los Fairlanes, Joe King Carrasco, Los Lonely Boys, Grupo Fantasma, Del Castillo, Ruben Ramos, Steve Jordan, Little Joe y la Familia, Alejandro Escobedo and  Patricia Vonne, to name a few, have all helped shape the music scene, which thrives in Austin. Hand-in-hand with music come Latin/o dances &mdash; a form of expression ranging from salsa to Tejano to the more formal ballet folklorico groups, like Roy Lozano's Ballet Folklorico de Tejas, which are in almost every school in Austin. And art: Mexican and Latino art in Austin is abundant, from folk art to fine art to modern and contemporary expression from emerging and established Latino artists. The influence of Latino art is ever-present, from the murals around town to the works of Fidencio Duran at the airport. Mexic-Arte Museum, La Pe√±a, the Serie Project and the galleries at the MACC &mdash; all are rich, vibrant institutions that proudly exhibit Latino art and educate the community about the variety of expressions it encompasses. Influences from the Latino color palette, imagery and techniques are seen in non-Hispanic art as well.</p>
		<p>Traditions, customs and celebrations come next: Dia de los Muertos, Diez y Seis de Septiembre and Cinco de Mayo are all rich cultural celebrations that Hispanics and non-Hispanics enjoy together. These festivities are filled with music, dance and food.  And let's not forget the rodeos &mdash; after all, it was the Spanish who brought horses and started the charreadas with skilled vaqueros, which began the cowboy tradition that continues to thrive in Austin.</p>
		<p>Film and TV personalities and producers also have had a huge impact on the Austin film industry and television. Film maker Robert Rodriguez and news anchors Olga Campos, Ron Oliveira, Fred Cantu and Michelle Valles are a few who have shaped this scene. The growing film industry in Austin is seeing more Latino talent enter the stage &mdash; from acting to production. </p>
		<p>Last, but not least, is religion. So much of Hispanic culture centers around their faith, and the Catholic faith is one that was brought over by the Spanish and is practiced by a majority of Hispanics.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="tab-2" class="tab-content">
		<p>The concepts of family and community are very important to the Hispanic culture. Latino families tend to be close-knit and extended multi-generational families &mdash; often they include friends (comadres and compadres). Even virtual strangers are tied together by their Hispanic culture and roots, and they support and respect each other. Latinos tend to value the group or family over the individual, and thus cooperation and respect is key, and the needs of the individual are often put behind the needs of family and community. Growing up, Hispanic children are taught to respect authority and their elders and to observe humility. To non-Hispanics unfamiliar with Hispanic culture, this can be misinterpreted as a sign that the importance placed on family and community and being humble impedes individual achievement and advancement, which is far from true. Others must learn to distinguish that Hispanics' cooperation, respect and humility is very different from being docile and dependent and underachieving. Rather, these traits have created a strong Hispanic community here in Austin made up of many successful individuals and businesses, which celebrates family, has made vibrant and important cultural contributions, and  is anything but docile and subservient.</p>
		<p>Hispanics also love to enjoy life &mdash; gozar la vida &mdash; but they are also hard workers. It should not be assumed that because Hispanics love to celebrate life and "stop to smell the roses" that they are lazy or underachievers. To the contrary, they are among the most industrious and hardworking in our community.</p>

	<div id="tab-3" class="tab-content">
		<p>With the Latino population continuing to rise at a more rapid rate than non-Hispanics, the impact of Hispanic culture will continue to grow exponentially. A strong sense of community and respect for family and the wonderfully vibrant traditions of Hispanic culture will also increase. Latino arts and art institutions will achieve more prominence and be more appreciated. I believe this growth will be a positive influence in the ever-changing, multicultural city that is Austin.</p>
