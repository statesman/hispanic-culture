		<p>Hispanic culture in Austin? Ha! Hispanic culture permeates throughout Austin &mdash; not just the names of our roads or our favorite breakfast food, nor Fajita Flats, now Ruby's BBQ, nor the state drink of Texas (a frozen margarita), but look at the laid-back lifestyle people enjoy in Austin. Even the tech wizs take off days for ACL, Formula 1 and SXSW, and despite a 24/7 reputation you'll find plenty of start-up entrepreneurs at Barton Springs or along Barton Creek during the weekend. Loving life, living life á la Hispanic culture is alive and well in Austin.</p>

	<div id="tab-2" class="tab-content">
		<p>I'm not sure many understand how multicultural is what we call Hispanic culture &mdash; even just in Austin: third-plus generation Hispanic families, second-generation Hispanic, immigrant families and all the permutations depending on from which country, then dice and slice again depending on their social economic status. Probably the greatest challenge for Austin and Central Texas as communities is educating the first-generation Hispanics, especially those whose parents aren't well-educated and don't have those parenting skills. But, let's not forget the realities of Darwinism &mdash; these parents risked a lot if not everything to get here. They do want better for their children. We have to reach them, educate them and mentor them. They and their families represent future entrepreneurs &mdash; do you know that immigrants are 30 percent more likely to start a business?</p>

		<p>Well, it might seem like a long time before Santiago and Sofia are 18 years old and eligible to vote, but if we've been harassing and threatening their parents for the last eight years, you think they are going to forget this when they are eligible to vote in 10? And, just because their demographic hasn't shown up to the polls in previous elections, are you gonna bet against my ability to get out their vote?</p>
