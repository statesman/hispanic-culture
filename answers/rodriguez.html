		<p>Outside of food, which I will leave to Addie Broyles to comment upon, from my viewpoint, the biggest impact of Hispanic culture in Austin is music. I have been an Austin resident since 1976. At that time, the music played and publicized downtown was mainly comprised of country, R&amp;B, rock and folk. Latin music existed but seldom frequented by mainstream (defined as Anglo Saxon/Caucasian) audiences (Beto y Los Fairlanes being one exception to the rule). Now, to my great delight, Latin music is becoming mainstream in venues other than Mexican food restaurants, and an occasional club, and as my mom would say, "¡Gracías a Dios!" Public taste is changing. When you can read in the local press that Grupo Fantasma, homegrown Grammy award winners, are playing at Austin's well-beloved Blues on the Green, you know that Latin music has arrived. The Latin music scene is not only bringing each country's musical traditions, but it is also fusing music with each other, as well as with mainstream American music. It is an exciting time in Austin for Latin music. One interesting way to look at this diversity is to go to one of any number of dance groups forming and thriving in Austin and witness the diversity of genres played: salsa (New York), merengue (Dominican Republic), cumbia (Colombia), son (Cuba), tango (Argentina), regetton (Panama), conjunto (hats off to Los Texas Wranglers, also Grammy award winners from Austin) and more.</p>

		<p>Some may think that Latin music in Austin is the newest trend in Austin's music scene, but in fact, the Hispanic influence is not new, only previously rarely visible to mainstream society. Latin music influence and culture has been present and thriving for a very long time. I think of Manuel Donley and Las Estrellas, 1955. Then comes to mind Little Joe y La Familia and other Tejano bands, who were playing in the early 70s to packed Hispanic audiences at Austin's old City Coliseum.</p>
		<p>The real question is not what is the least understood impact, but rather why the misunderstanding. Mainstream society is the purveyor of cultural taste and opinion. Cultural opinion has historically been expressed by Caucasian and Anglo Saxon males. These views represent and express news on only a part of the population: historically, those in power, economically, socially and politically &mdash; historically, white males. Although this is changing, even today an exhibit hangs in the Austin History Center titled "Latinas in the Shadow of the Live Music Capital of the World." The invisible is becoming visible as the population changes, and producing a changing market. The musical impact of Hispanics, occasionally or lightly acknowledged historically, is now, at long last, gaining the recognition it deserves.</p>

	<div id="tab-3" class="tab-content">
		<p>The biggest impact in the future is a change in perspective. Instead of assimilating populations, we are acculturating. Assimilation is where one's culture loses its cultural practices and identity to the dominant culture. Acculturation is a process where the cultural aspects of the majority community are adapted without losing the traditions and customs of the minority community. The playing field is being leveled for there to be more give and take for all cultures. The change in population creates more possibility for equality in social, political, economic and cultural exchanges. An additional future impact is that the Hispanic culture enables Austin to become a more forward-thinking global city. The Hispanic culture, while sharing a common language, is global. With attention, awareness and hard work, Hispanic contributions both present and forthcoming bring the hope of a more inclusive society for all humankind. ¡Gracías a Dios!</p>
