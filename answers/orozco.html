		<p>The biggest impact of Hispanic culture is that the presence and influence are growing and will continue to grow. Even the word "Hispanic" has been impacted by the "Latinazation" of Austin culture. More and more one hears the word Latino instead of Hispanic. Latinos – with the majority being Mexican and Mexican-American – are 40 percent of the population. In the schools almost 60 percent. The biggest impact is that Latino culture is everywhere – in food, music, art, language, movies, fashion, holidays (Dia de los Muertos, Cinco de Mayo), etc. The various aspects of culture, whether it is food or music or art, are influencing and catapulting Latino culture to higher levels of not only acceptance but desirability throughout the community. Mexic-Arte Museum will celebrate its 30th year this year, founded in 1984. I, the founders, artists, supporters and hundreds of people serving on the board and committees have worked diligently to share and promote the Mexican, Mexican-American and Latino culture. Our mission has been dedicated to cultural enrichment and education through the presentation and promotion of traditional and contemporary Mexican, Latino and Latin-American art and culture. Mexic-Arte Museum probably has made the biggest impact on the promotion and preservation of Hispanic/Latino culture in Austin through the museum and all the artists and organizations that have been assisted. Thousands of children and people have been touched by the programs centered in Latino/Mexican/Mexican-American culture that Mexic-Arte Museum has presented and produced.</p>

		<p>The magnificence of the Latino/Mexican culture, the history and all the contributions that the Mexican/Mexican-American Latino culture has had on our society and community in Austin today is the least understood impact. The community of Austin does not understand or recognize the contributions of the Mexican people in the development of this city. Very few people know that the Mexican people once lived and worked in downtown Austin around the area of Republic Square. That is why the naming and development of the Fifth Street Mexican American Heritage Corridor is so important. As a community we must bring into the civic consciousness the contributions of the Mexican/Mexican-American people in Austin. The need for the development of a world-class building for the Mexic-Arte Museum and its collection and the impact it will have on our city is also not fully understood.</p>

	<div id="tab-3" class="tab-content">
		<p>The impact can be great if the city of Austin and its entire community embrace the Latino culture, Latino artists and Latino arts institutions like Mexic-Arte Museum and interpret Latino culture as an incredibly valuable asset to our city. Austin's proximity to Mexico, the vibrancy of the creative community and the large Latino population position Austin as a nexus for international and local and national bicultural exchange and collaboration. Mexic-Arte Museum has been a pioneer and leader in positioning Austin.</p>
