		<p>Big question and not easily answered because we continually grope to define the word "culture." If culture means the societal fabric, then it is equally difficult to gauge "impact" because Latinos or Hispanos have long since integrated the social, legal, educational, political and entertainment cultures of the city. Cisco's and Matt's El Rancho restaurants, for example, were not only places to eat, but became places for people to gather and exchange views and news since the early 1950s. Alfonso and Ruben Ramos were famous statewide Tejano musicians who ranked with the bigger names of the genre but never really got their due. Nonetheless, they planted an Austin artistic flag on their tour stops. The late Nash Hernandez kept the big band sound alive with a mixture of English and Spanish language standards for years. His son continues the tradition, playing to packed houses at Donn's Depot and  other venues. Then there are mariachi groups that do so well at least one of them boasts that their members don't need day jobs &mdash; a boast that eludes most Austin musicians. Austin's theater scene also is replete with local playwrights and actors who produce and perform. The Latino Comedy Project has faded but during its run enjoyed popularity. Again, its contributions were never fully acknowledged.</p>
        <p>The political story enjoys wider circulation. Everybody knows about Richard Moya and John Trevino and Gus García, but less well known is the political muscle that Roy Velasquez, founder of Roy's Taxi, and Rudy Cisneros, the owner of Cisco's, flexed before any of them were elected. Cisneros and Velazquez were tough, colorful and economically independent. They were great stories but have long since left us. The late Gustavo (Gus) García, a lawyer who died drunk, broke and disgraced but nonetheless hailed as a great legal mind, was in and out of Austin in the late 40s and through the early 60s. He was the lead lawyer in the Delgado vs. Bastrop federal suit (1948) that ended with several area school districts, including Austin's, agreeing not to segregate Latino students and cracked open the doors of school houses to Hispanic students. It is a battle that continues to this day but the impact of the decision has a long reach. Incidentally, García was John Connally's debate partner when they were both students at UT Law School in the 1930s. Those brief examples should get anyone seriously interested in delving deeper into this topic started and something to think about.</p>

		<p>Part of the answer to this question is contained in the content above. But to elaborate, the city as we know it couldn't have developed without the Latino manual laborers. A windshield survey of construction sites will confirm that. Since the 1970s, a battery of lawyers, bankers, real estate brokers, all part of the infrastructure necessary to facilitate growth and development, have taken their places in the development of modern Austin. So, Latinos not only provided the brawn, but the brains, that are necessary to a city's growth. The point should be obvious by now: No serious discussion of the "Hispanic" influence could or should regard as something separate. This is our home, and we affect the city both positively and negatively, just like every other population group. Latinos are not, nor ever have been, a monolith. People are different because their backgrounds, educational levels and socioeconomic status inform worldviews. Not all Latinos agreed with Velasquez, Cisneros, Moya or any other politicians, but then neither do all Anglos agree with Lee Leffingwell or Rick Perry.</p>

		<p>This question is most difficult to answer with precision, but there is one safe prediction: Latino population growth will bring with it demands for education, for living space, for transportation. There is no "Hispanic" approach to moving people around, but mobility will affect the ability of people to make a living, to patronize retailers and entertainment venues. Education, of course, will affect economic flexibility to enjoy what the region has to offer. While Hispanic poverty gets a lot of attention, there has been considerable growth in Latino professionals. When I got to Austin in 1974, it was literally possible for one person to know every Latino doctor and lawyer. Now, it's not so easy because the professional ranks have swelled. Because the upper-income Latinos are successful products of the educational system &mdash; some would argue they succeeded despite a hostile educational system &mdash; they will seeks a "quality of life" not so indistinct from Anglos and African-Americans in similar circumstances. The rub will be leading as many of the swelling numbers of Latino youngsters to opportunities that will only be available to them if they are fully educated and fully employed.</p>
