		<p>It's taken a while for the people on the west side to accept equal citizenship for us. Back when I was young it was hard. We couldn't get the good jobs. In the 1950s and part of the '60s, banks in Austin didn't hire Hispanics. They wouldn't let them be clerks, cashiers, bankers. It took cultural change to realize that though our color is different, we aren't really different. Anglos liked our food, but they didn't really like us. You could also charge a lot more for rice, beans and hamburger meat on the west side. But we are balancing that out. The hardest thing was getting accepted. I can't blame it on anything else other than the Alamo. Young people don't realize it wasn't Anglos vs. Mexicans. It was Texicans against the Mexican government. As time goes by, the true history gets lost. Not my children so much, but my grandchildren and great-grandchildren are not going to remember any of this. They are already assimilating. They aren't going to feel the same way about our culture as I do. If an 18-year-old came in here right now (Quickie Pickie on East 11th Street) and we asked her about Tejano music, she wouldn't know what we were talking about.</p>

		<p>Opportunities: I've been here long enough to see a lot of progress. There's still a little bit of problem for Hispanics to serve in high-paying, policy-making jobs. It's amazing, though, when you see minorities getting into the heads of government &mdash; city, county, state. It happens when we are given an opportunity to participate and further educate our children The key is education. Back when I was county commissioner, they required a college degree for many jobs. It was a way of weeding out: Requiring a college degree. I was able to get that rule changed to a college degree &mdash; or the equivalent of one. Job opportunities have since gotten better. And we can demonstrate that our folks can do it. The lady who's going to run the medical school hospital is a Hispanic. I can guarantee you 30, 40 years ago, she wouldn't have gotten it. They don't do all they ought to do, but they are getting there. Now, we need to get more of our young people to run for office.</p>

		<p>Diversity is the key to everything. If you don't know the other people in this community, if you just stay in your part of town, you know, the way Austin used to be, we will be lost. My daddy used to tell me we know everybody in our part of town. In the old days, when you bought a house, you had a book with narrow pages, it had information on the land, they had covenants that you couldn't sell to: I'm going to say African-Americans or Mexican-Americans, to be polite. They had to pass a law to strike that down. We had a lot of fights at the junior high level about everything. Allan Junior High. Some people I know don't like what's happening in our community: The fact of mixed marriages. You have to be real old-fashioned to feel that way. Eventually, you don't see any difference. When I was in junior high, I became a good buddy with Franklin McMullen. One day he came to school, he said, "Are you Spanish?" "No, I'm Mexican." "Oh, I can't invite you to my party." I spend a lot of time trying to get young people to run for office nowadays. They only one I could convince was my daughter, who ran for school board. Now that's a thankless job!</p>
