		<p>I base and say this not as an unbiased observer but someone whose ancestors have been in Austin since 1872 and thus lived/experienced the life/culture in the city to the present. First, it is Mexican culture, not Hispanic. That word is something imported from the outside, what you call it. In the past we have been called Spanish, Latin-American, Latino, Mexican-American and Hispanic &mdash; and by ourselves to define particular areas at different times: La Raza, Chicano and others.</p>
        <p>My observations are mostly history-based. Again, my earliest ancestors came from Mexico to San Antonio in 1852. It was a city they would have been familiar with from Mexico. It was a city founded by early Spanish pioneers, a few Spanish, mostly Mestizos and then some Canary Islanders (who thought their shit didn't stink, but that is another story). There is a joke that – if you've been in the older part of the city makes sense &mdash; by "two drunken Mexicans on a burro, who was probably drunk as well." The very architecture, the missions, the Alamo, San Fernando Cathedral and Governor's Palace all reflect Spanish/Mexican origins. The Spanish names for streets and landmarks stand out. The economy was not slave-driven. San Antonio marks then divide from there south is all brown and white, the further south you go the more brown than white. A community with sufficient numbers to maintain its culture through the Republic and early statehood. San Antonio has sustained with continuity a thriving cultural community, maintaining its Mexican roots.</p>
		<p>Austin, founded 1839 (sorry for the history lesson, which you already know, but I'm using in this context), city laid out on a grid plan. All streets given English names, except for the rivers, which kept their Spanish names but lost their literal meanings and associations. First settlers were mostly all white Americans with their slaves. Homes and buildings constructed in a totally different style. A culture of politics, religion, education and even food completely alien when compared with San Antonio. There is little mention of Mexican individuals, much less a cultural community in early Austin history. When there is documentation, it is in regards to the expulsion of that whole community in 1854. It had to do with the whole pre-Civil War national paranoia of the 1850s.</p>
		<p>The Mexican population lived in tents at the mouth of Shoal Creek. Accounts of their numbers vary from about 40 to 60. They were viewed with much suspicion: a different color, language, religion and culture. The whites had more in common with their enslaved community. There were fears that Mexicans were encouraging slaves to make a run for the Mexican border and freedom. With this cause the whites sent out a vigilante committee to go to the Mexican settlement and declare that they had two weeks to vacate the city. It wasn't until the early 1870s that there were sufficient numbers of Mexicans to be regarded as a community. Again, my ancestors were part of that re-establishment population. Always isolated, never culturally recognized, Mexicans remained a gray area between the white/black-dominated culture. Mexicans viewed whites and blacks as little different culturally; they spoke the same language, same religion, food, clothes, music, business and social structure. This population of just several hundred remained stable until about 1910.</p>
        <p>As with the current issues of today, we have viewed it as a matter of thousands of years of migration (following resources) and not emigration. With the Mexican Revolution of 1910 there was a large influx of native Mexicans. There was friction then and still is with each new wave of emigrants. Mexicans – or now Hispanics – are the only ethnic group that is still coming. Whites and their slaves the first, followed by Germans, Swedes, Lebanese, Jews, Vietnamese and now just all these New People have had their time. Within the Hispanic culture there is much diversity with each new wave of emigrants, and while enriching the culture there has not been the strength that has marked Austin's city culture of white/black. There is a competition for limited resources, and the prevailing view from outside is that we are always treated as one with the latest emigrant and denied a past in Austin's history. Even food trailers, which began as taco stands in the East Side as a wave of emigrants brought them from Mexico in the 1980s, doesn't get the credit for the fad. So Austin's based Mexican/Hispanic culture has followed a parallel course with Austin's white/black culture with not very often really being a part of that culture. Gloria Espetia at the Austin History Center has done much to recover and document much of this culture in her programming for the Austin History Center. While there has been some successful individual crossovers in food and music, the impact of a native Austin Mexican/Hispanic cultural impact on the city as a whole has, I think, been negligible.</p>

		<p>By "here" do you mean the city of  Austin? It has been and is not even thought about. How can "Hispanic" culture have an "impact" when it has never been in the mainstream? That there is a historic, home-grown Austin "Hispanic" culture of over 140 years would come as a surprise to most Austin citizens, old and new.</p>
		<p>Example: Gloria Espetia has uncovered a long, rich and vibrant "Hispanic" music scene: performers, bands, orchestras, venues, recording studios, music shops and fans. She was the first to document this music aspect of Austin's "Hispanic" culture. Another example: and yet, time and time again we see articles, revivals of, remember whens, the importance of Austin's punk fad of the 1980s. The punk period has been idolized, glorified and enshrined as a landmark in Austin's music history. Please! "Least understood" – not even in the conversation when it comes to music, dance, theater and painting. I recognize the singular "Hispanic" cultural center, museum and art venues, but these are only tokens in the cultural life of Austin.</p>

		<p>The same as it is now and has been in the past – nada! It is our culture made for and by us. It needs no approval or validation from outside. Even though Ruben Ramos has appeared on Austin City Limits (twice I think), Manuel "Cowboy" Donley and Johnny Degollado never will. And while there are the bronze statures of Stevie and Willie, the Tejano Walk of fame just doesn't cut it with those funky, industrial piles of scrap metal; we didn't put it up. And I'm fine with that, because you know what, we're not making "Hispanic" culture for you.</p>
