		<p>I believe the biggest impact of Hispanic culture on Austin has been the influx and influence of people from the Rio Grande Valley and San Antonio who moved to Austin in the 1960s and 1970s. Many of these individuals may have come to attend the University of Texas at Austin and decided to make Austin their home. Many who came to Austin were teachers, attorneys and other professionals. There was a definite increase in restaurants serving Mexican food, as well as a new kind of food called Interior and Tex-Mex, compared to the traditional Mexican food of the 1950s served at El Matamoros and Matt's El Rancho, for example.</p>
        <p>The greatest surprise for me as to the impact of Hispanic culture in Austin was the addition of a group of Austin musicians called Mariachi Estrella, established by Billy Mendoza. To my knowledge, there had never been a mariachi based in Austin until 1974. In 1979, Manuel Gonzales established his mariachi, Mariachi Guadalupanos, with his children playing all the instruments. I returned to Austin in 1979 to accept a position with the Austin Independent School District as an orchestra teacher. My career had always been as an instrumental music teacher. I quickly joined the Austin Symphony Orchestra as a violist. I had been a member of the Austin Symphony as an undergraduate student in the School of Music at UT-Austin. When Billy Mendoza asked me to become a member of Mariachi Estrella, I had to choose whether to continue with the Austin Symphony or join Mariachi Estrella. What I saw as the impact of the Hispanic culture on Austin and what I could do to promote mariachi music prompted me to retire from the Austin Symphony and concentrate my efforts with Mariachi Estrella.</p>
		<p>I became aware of the impact of Hispanic culture in Austin in 1980, when AISD asked me to pioneer a mariachi program at Fulmore Middle School and at Travis High School. This was the first time AISD included mariachi music with the band, orchestra and choir programs in the district. In a very short time, I discovered that as the founder and director of the Travis High School Mariachi Rebeldes del Sur, the Hispanic community supported all my efforts with the Rebeldes del Sur. We were invited to perform at many community events, and in 1986, I was the first Hispanic to receive the prestigious AISD Teacher of The Year Award. Since 1986, more and more Hispanics have received the AISD Teacher of The Year Award. Bilingual programs that were not in place before the 1960s are providing content area learning, as well as emphasis on various aspects of our Hispanic culture, such as Cinco de Mayo celebrations with music and folklorico dancing.</p>
        <p>In the summer of 2011, I again became aware of the impact Hispanic culture had in Austin. Fifty years after receiving my B.M. degree in viola pedagogy from the School of Music, I was invited to join the faculty of the Butler School of Music at UT as lecturer and director of the UT Mariachi Ensemble, the Mariachi Paredes de Tejastitlán. I had come home to where I first began my classical music training at the age of 9. With the successful experiences I had in developing a mariachi program, the UT Mariachi Ensemble has been very visible and has performed for university and community events. Support from the Hispanic community has been quite notable. In 2012, plans for a University of Texas Longhorn Mariachi Camp were in the works. Support and donations from generous individuals made it possible for the university to witness the first-ever 2013 Longhorn Mariachi Camp for Texas high school students whose family would not have had the funds for them to attend a camp such as the annual band, orchestra and choir Longhorn camps. The 2013 Longhorn Mariachi Camp was such a great success that in the summer of 2014, high school students again participated in the second annual Longhorn Mariachi Camp. With the strong support of the Hispanic community, mariachi music is now in the limelight at the University of Texas at Austin.</p>
        <p>I see the impact of Hispanic culture on Austin every Thursday evening when my professional mariachi ensemble, Mariachi Castro, plays at Matt's El Rancho. Many of the patrons are not Hispanic and can be seen enjoying a delicious variety of Mexican cuisine and enjoying mariachi music! Numerous patrons request "Las Mananitas," the traditional Mexican birthday serenade. At times patrons may request to sing along with us, and others join in with clapping and shouting out the traditional "gritos" (encouraging shouts of joy) associated with mariachi music. As a result of the enjoyment provided by our music, many times patrons request us to perform for various events, which include weddings and private parties. To sum up my thoughts on the biggest impact of Hispanic culture on Austin, I will  state that the increased number of Hispanics and their influence in our community in the area of the arts and entertainment will continue to enrich the lives of Austinites in the future.</p>

		<p>I believe the least understood impact of that culture here in Austin is the appreciation of the influence and contributions by Tejanos in Texas. Tejanos have always been intelligent, industrious, committed, strong Texans, and proud Americans. Tejanos and Hispanics from Central and South America in Austin love and appreciate their culture and enjoy sharing all aspects of their culture with Austinites.</p>

		<p>I believe that the Hispanic population is growing rapidly and the future of Austin lies in the energizing contributions of our rich Hispanic culture. On March 29, 2012, an important event took place that will have an unprecedented impact of Hispanic culture on Austin's future: The unveiling of the Tejano Monument on the Capitol's south lawn. The $2 million bronze monument was the result of a 13-year united effort from Hispanic leaders across the state of Texas. The largest monument on any capitol grounds in the United States, it honors 500 years of Tejano contributions to the state of Texas. UT was heavily involved in celebrating the monument. The Mariachi Paredes de Tejastitlán was in full traditional Mariachi Trajes, complete with burnt-orange Bevo bow ties. The Mariachi Ensemble performed the Star-Spangled Banner for the opening ceremony. "The future of Texas is tied directly to the future of Hispanics," stated Gov. Rick Perry at the ceremony, "and I believe we have a glorious future ahead of us." It is my strong belief that our young Hispanic children will have opportunities that we have never before imagined. They will become our future leaders in this great city of Austin.</p>
