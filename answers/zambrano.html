		<p>With the exception of breakfast tacos – which food, I think is the biggest impact so far.  However, I don't believe we've seen the impact of the Hispanic culture in our community yet. We are still a relatively unknown and unseen community, with the exception of a few: Terry Lozano-Long, Mayor Gus Garcia, etc. The Hispanic community is an extremely entrepreneur – everything from the man who rides around selling ice cream from his cart (which you could say the food trailers started our community) to having one of the top 10 Hispanic agencies in the US – LatinWorks. </p>

		<p>That we are an extremely diverse culture, representing over 17 countries. Each with its own art, culture, customs, etc.</p>

		<p>Hispanics in all our diversity are here to stay, in Austin, in Texas, in the United States.  We share many common values that are important to all of us.  Love of family, love of tradition, pride in our culture, a strong faith tradition, a strong work ethic, fierce loyalty to the family members and friends we hold dear, and an exuberance for living. But, like members of any ethnic group, we also want to be recognized as individuals. Like many families, we don't all agree on politics, faith, etc. But we do agree on our love of Austin, and we want to make a contribution. Let's focus on how we can continue to work together with shared values to keep Austin vibrant, special and welcoming to all.</p>
