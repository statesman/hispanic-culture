		<p>As Austin has grown, transformed, matured and established itself as a national, if not international, destination, there is one aspect of Hispanic culture that continues to leave its imprint on Austin and beyond &mdash; that is our food. Austin has always been a Tex-Mex pioneer in our great state, from early staples like Joe's Bakery, El Azteca, Cisco's and Matt's El Rancho to current-day success stories like Chuy's, Maudie's, Casa García's and Serrano's. However, as the city welcomed a new generation of Hispanic restaurateurs, we began to see the impact of regional versions of Mexican and Tex-Mex with the likes of El Chile, Vivo, El Naranjo, Taqueria Arandas, Taqueria Chapala, Takoba, El Habanero, Los Cuervos and the Texican Café. You began to see the influence of San Antonio, El Paso and Jalisco in the local cuisines of Austin, keeping pace with the changing local Hispanic demographics. And now, with a new influx of international influences, we are seeing great Colombian (Casa Colombia), Cuban and Argentinian food make its impact in Austin. And I would be remiss if I didn't mention the "taco" craze going on in Austin, with everything from Taco Deli to Torchy's Tacos to the Don Juan Taco at Juan In a Million. The Hispanic food culture in Austin continues to impress local Austinites and the world beyond!</p>

		<p>I would say that the least understood impact of the Hispanic food culture in Austin is how the early roots of authentic Tex-Mex were the predecessors of most of the wonderful things we enjoy today, from Kerby Queso to breakfast tacos to Hawaiian fajitas. There were a lot of pioneers, such as Matt's El Rancho and Spanish Village, that were serving chili con queso and taquitos way before it was on trend. And, according to my dad, there were many earlier restaurants along Red River, which in earlier days was a main street for Mexican families in Austin.</p>

	<div id="tab-3" class="tab-content">
		<p>As our city's Hispanic population continues to diversify and grow, Austinites will have a keen appreciation and understanding for the differences in various Hispanic cultures, knowing the difference between an arepa and a gordita or a Quilmes and a Tecate or what it means to be a 'pana' versus a 'compa.' The various Hispanic cultures will add to the attraction of Austin as global city.</p>
