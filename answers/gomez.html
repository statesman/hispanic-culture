		<p>Our biggest impact on Austin has been the introduction of our culture, language, history, food and traditions. In the late 1950s, Mexican-American students in Austin took our lunch of tacos to school. We preferred it, but it was unknown and unrecognized by others. Today, that has totally changed, and now the taco has been absorbed by others and Anglicized. I remember in the mid-90s buying tacos al pastor from a little trailer on Riverside Drive. Before I knew it, trailers selling food exploded all over Austin. </p> 
		<p>Our celebrations of Cinco de Mayo and Diez y Seis have hopefully brought about Austin's understanding of the Mexican-American population whose ancestors have been in this part of the country for centuries. These celebrations are more than just a party, because they help us remember the historic events that our parents and grandparents told us about.  </p>
		<p>When we talk about "Hispanic" versus "Mexican-Americans," the former refers to all of the countries in Latin America and Mexico that are represented in our community. We have all learned about salsa, merengue, bachata, etc., in addition to jarabe tapatio, La Negra, Mexico Lindo y Querido, etc., and pupusas, arepas and gorditas.  </p>
		<p>However, I am a Mexican-American whose ancestors came from Mexico, next door to Texas. Mexicans have been open to visiting throughout Latin America, sharing music, food and traditions. My grandparents came to Texas to escape the Mexican Revolution in 1917 when my father was a 2-year-old toddler. My great-grandfather came from Spain and settled in Guanajuato, and my great-grandmother was Mexican. On my mother's side, my grandfather and grandmother were Mexican. My maternal grandmother was very light-skinned and had green eyes. I had a very special relationship with both sets of grandparents and spoke Spanish to them as a young girl. I wrote letters to them in Spanish.</p>
		<p>I was born in Fentress, Texas, on a farm because my grandparents and parents were farmworkers.  They migrated to Michigan and other states north. They raised their food. I suppose they were the first environmentalists I ever met. They moved to Austin because there was a job waiting for my father that paid him 35 cents an hour in 1944. I was 3 months old when we moved to Austin. He was frugal, saved his money, bought some land in South Austin and built a house. Later, he bought more land and built another house in South Austin. Taxes were affordable then.</p>
        <p>Recent stories of how the governor of Texas is responding to the children at the border emphasize the horrible dismissal of Mexicans and Mexican-Americans in this state and in this country. It is, however, a good feeling of the respect that some people do have for these children as they are responding to them as human beings, wanting to contribute to their basic needs of shelter, food, clothes and safety. But generally, there are others who are showing their disdain and hatred for these children and thus showing their ignorance of our global relationship to other countries and their people.</p>
		<p>For more information of the history of Mexicans and Mexican-Americans in Texas, I recommend books by Andres Tijerina and David Monetejano to learn our perspective of Texas history. Also, refer to "The Law of the Noose:  A History of Latino Lynchings" by R. Delgado, 2009, Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Libertie Law Review, 44, 297-312. I would also recommend a book by Jovita Gonzalez, who wrote about life in South Texas, as well as "El Mesquite" by Elena Zamora O'Shea.</p>

		<p>There seems to be no understanding or recognition of Hispanic or Mexican-American families. We stay together, helping each other make it through the morass of rules, laws, policies, etc. A perfect example is the election of President Lyndon B. Johnson, who then passed the Civil Rights Law and the Voting Rights Act. We registered to vote, and we helped others register as well. Yet today, we find ourselves having to hire attorneys to help us fight the gerrymandering of district lines that minimize our ability to elect a person of our own choosing and to fight the voter ID that adversely impacted us and especially Mexican-American women. Sure does feel like targeted actions continue to be taken to keep us out of the system.</p>
		<p>What is it about Mexican-Americans that makes the world ignore our presence on improving the infrastructure of this country, this state, this county? Workers can put up rock fences faster and better than most tradesmen, and they are affordable. I see their work lasting a long time, too. Aren't we always asking for people who do the work right the first time, get the job done on time and under budget? Many work outdoors by landscaping and do a great job. This interest comes from working the land for years and years.</p>
		<p>There doesn't seem to be an understanding of working families who concentrate on jobs, decent pay to stay off welfare, affordable housing, affordable food and good, accessible education for their children.</p>
		<p>I am a lifelong resident of the city of Austin and believe that I have earned the right to pinpoint the things about Austin that are missing. Austin is very caught up in being the leader in so many fields, regardless of cost, and has lost sight of taking care of the longtime families that make up this community. It feels like Austin does not care for ordinary families of color who are at different places in life but who want to be recognized, respected and accepted. Many families of color enjoy being with their friends at events in different parts of Austin but find that they cannot afford to live here anymore. Consequently, we have a lot of commuting to Austin for jobs and services. But, the money they earn goes to other communities outside of Austin.</p>
		<p>On behalf of my community and based on expressions they have made to me, I would say that Mexican-Americans generally feel unrecognized and undervalued by Austin. There are exceptions to this as some Mexican-American families are being successful.</p> 
		<p>I would recommend to all that they read the poem "I Am Joaquin" by Rodolfo "Corky" Gonzales, written in 1966 but appropriate for 2014.</p>

		<p>I believe that we must be proud of who we are and accept ourselves. I believe that we need to keep working on learning all that we can about the place in which we are situated by the grace of God so that we can have a positive impact on the future of Austin. We must always remember that we made it on the shoulders of those who came before us and always look back to see who needs our helping hand.</p>
		<p>We must concentrate on encouraging all children to like school, to like doing homework, to like reading and math and science. We all share in the responsibility of mentoring and tutoring Austin's children so that we pull together forward on making Austin affordable for all families, improving the civic participation of all families and voting for our political interests. We have a saying, "No les des el garrote para que te peguen en la maceta."  "Don't hand them the bat with which to beat you over the head." This takes critical and independent thinking.</p>
