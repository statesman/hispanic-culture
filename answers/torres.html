		<p>Food &mdash; everyone loves Latin food and has a favorite Mexican or Latin restaurant. Also, food is not intimidating to people; over the years you had different strains of Mexican/Texas food that led to Tex-Mex, now made famous by places like Chuy's. In general, there is a love a affair with most ethnic foods, being that Austin has a huge Hispanic community, and Mexicans make up over 60 percent of Hispanics, you get the food influences that come with the relationship between the two.</p>

	<div id="tab-2" class="tab-content">
		<p>Language &mdash; we now see more advertising and messages in Spanish. I think people feel and see the growth of the Hispanic community all around them; some Hispanics see this as payback for being a minority for so long. I feel that we should educate people about our cultures and traditions in a non-intrusive way so people want to learn more about us and our language.</p>

	<div id="tab-3" class="tab-content">
		<p>It will all depend on the Hispanic community: If we do more to educate our kids and continue teaching them Spanish, their culture and traditions, then it'll be positive. Also our growth and presence can have a positive or negative effect. Growth will give us more poverty and put a strain on Austin's infrastructure; we can shrink the poverty level through education. With education comes better jobs, more opportunities, better living conditions and productive leaders of the community; people outside the Hispanic community will see this in a more positive light and will give us more respect.</p>
